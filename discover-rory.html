    <h2>From Holywood to the World</h2>
    <p>
      Hollywood Golf Club in Northern Ireland isn't just any golf course — it's the birthplace of one of golf’s greatest champions. Rory McIlroy began playing here as a young boy, nurturing his talent among the scenic fairways and rolling hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rory went on to achieve global fame, becoming one of the few players to win four Major Championships: the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and two PGA Championships. In 2025, he cemented his legacy by finally capturing the Masters title at Augusta, completing a historic career Grand Slam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors to Holywood can experience the same greens that honed Rory’s legendary skill, offering a rare chance to walk in the footsteps of greatness.
